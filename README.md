👋 Hi, I’m Gene — a technical operations leader and problem-solver with 15+ years of experience scaling IT systems, leading service management programs, and delivering resilient infrastructure in global environments.

My work focuses on making complex systems simple, reliable, and easy to support—so people can stay focused on the work that matters.

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)

Cloud Platforms (Azure, AWS)

ITSM & Support Automation (ServiceNow, Jira)

Data & Observability (Power BI, Splunk, Grafana, SQL, Snowflake)

Security & IAM (CISSP, Okta, BeyondTrust, Azure AD, zScaler)

DevOps Practices (CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, CircleCI)

Scripting & Integration (PowerShell, Bash, C#, JavaScript)

🧠 Interests:

Building human-centered systems that scale

Operational visibility & incident management

Cloud cost optimization (FinOps)

Team enablement and mentorship

Tools that quietly do their job
